    <p>Snickers is a chocolate bar made by the American company Mars, Incorporated, consisting of nougat topped with caramel and peanuts that is encased in milk chocolate.</p>
    The early (1939) ingredients list includes white sugar, sweet milk chocolate, corn syrup, peanuts, milk condensed with sugar, coconut oil, malted milk, whites of eggs and salt. By 2019, the ingredients for the original bar had been refined to milk chocolate (sugar, cocoa butter, chocolate, skim milk, lactose, milkfat, soy lecithin, artificial flavor), peanuts, corn syrup, sugar, palm oil, skim milk, lactose, salt, egg whites, artificial flavor.
    <p>Over the years, the bar weight has decreased: Before 2009, in the UK a single Snickers bar had a weight of 62.5g. This weight was subsequently reduced to 58g in 2009, and to 48g in 2013.[20] In the United States the listed weight in 2018 was 52.7 g. In Australia, Snickers bars were originally made locally and weighed 53g, however in the late 2010s production moved to China and the bars were shrunk to 50g. In 2022, production returned to Australia and bars further reduced in weight to 44g.</p>
